Description:
The Snake Game is a classic and popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game borders. As the snake consumes more food, it increases in length, making the game more challenging.

Features:
1. **Snake Movement:** The player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
2. **Food Generation:** Food appears at random positions on the screen for the snake to eat.
3. **Scoring:** Each time the snake eats food, the player scores points, and the snake grows longer.
4. **Collision Handling:** The game checks for collisions between the snake's head, body, and the screen borders.
5. **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or hits the screen borders.
6. **User Interface:** Simple console-based user interface for display.

Implementation:
The game is implemented in C++ using standard console input/output functions. The snake's movement is controlled by updating its position in a 2D array representing the game screen. Food generation, collision detection, and scoring are handled through logical conditions.

Instructions:
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
3. Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
4. Eat food to score points and grow the snake.
5. Avoid collisions to keep the game going.
